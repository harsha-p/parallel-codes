# Optimised Matrix Multiplication

This is an optimised matrix multiplication program written in C using OpenMP.

This repository contains the intel MKL matrix multiplication program, the OpenMP matrix multiplication program written by me and compiled using g++ and icc.

I have optimised the matrix multiplication program using OpenMP to achieve the best performance.
I used the Intel OneAPI tool to analyse the performance of the program.

I developed the program on a Linux machine with 48 logical cores and 96 threads of Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6148 CPU @ 2.40GHz with 2 sockets.

The performance of the program was close to the performance of the Intel MKL matrix multiplication program.
